# Command: /digest

**What it does:** Placeholder for a daily summary digest.  Will aggregate
new listings, on-hold changes, sold confirmations, and top recommendations
into a single notification.

**Status:** Not yet implemented.  The individual event notifications
(new / on-hold / sold) already fire in real time via watchdog.py.
